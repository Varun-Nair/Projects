# Passport_Smart_Contract_Challenge
My first smart contract 

Has the functionality to:
- instantiate the contract and set the owner
- support a read query to get the owner of the smart contract
- store the scores for multiple addresses in the smart contract state (ex. {address_1: 10, address_2: 20})
- support an execute message where only the owner of the smart contract can set the score of an address (ex. so the owner, who is address_1, can set the score for address_2)
- support a read query to get the score for a particular address
