Gitlet", is a version control system (like Git) to save different versions and histories of files. 

This implements features on both the local desktop and remote repositories. This had similar functionalities to git, with basic features like add, commit, merge, branch, log, status, and I implemented advanced features that can be seen in my GitHub "Projects" repository.
